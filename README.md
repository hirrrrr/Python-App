General idea of the application:

This code creates a Tkinter window with a canvas and two buttons. Clicking the "Load Image" button will download a random geometric image from the specified GitHub repository and render it at a random location on the canvas. The image can be selected and moved by clicking and dragging it. Clicking the "Group Images" button will group the currently selected images as a single object. The selected images will then move together as a group.

Explanation of the code:

The code utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) application. It defines a class called ImageApp, which encapsulates the functionality of the application.

In the constructor __init__(self, root), the ImageApp object is initialized with a Tkinter window (root) and a canvas. The canvas is set to a specific size and packed into the window. Several buttons, including "Load Image", "Group Images", "Change Color", "Change Size", and "Connect Centers", are created and packed into the window.

The load_image() method is triggered when the "Load Image" button is clicked. It generates a random number to select a random geometric image from the specified GitHub repository. The image is then downloaded from the repository and saved locally with a unique filename. The render_image() method is called to display the downloaded image on the canvas at a random position.

The render_image(image_path) method takes an image path as input. It opens the image using the PIL (Python Imaging Library) library, resizes it to a desired size (in this case, 50x50 pixels), and converts it to a Tkinter-compatible format using ImageTk.PhotoImage(). The image is then rendered on the canvas using the create_image() method, specifying the image, its position, an anchor point, and associating it with a specific tag (image_path). Mouse event bindings are also set up for image selection, movement, and double-click to display image information.

The select_image(event, image_path=None) method is responsible for selecting and deselecting images on the canvas. When an image is clicked, this method is called with the corresponding image path. It checks if the image is already selected and toggles its selection state accordingly. The selected image is outlined with a red border. If no image path is provided, the method deselects all currently selected images on the canvas.

The move_selected_images(event) method handles the movement of selected images on the canvas. When the user drags the mouse while holding down the left button, this method is called. It retrieves the current mouse position from the event and updates the positions of all selected images on the canvas using the coords() method.

The group_images() method is triggered when the "Group Images" button is clicked. It checks if there are more than one selected image and adds all currently selected images to the grouped_images list. It then clears the selected_images list and removes the outline from the grouped images on the canvas.

The change_color() method is invoked when the "Change Color" button is clicked. It opens a color chooser dialog using the colorchooser module. If a color is chosen, it updates the fill color of all selected images on the canvas.

The change_size() method is triggered when the "Change Size" button is clicked. It prompts the user to enter a new size (in pixels) using a dialog box. If a valid size is provided, it resizes all selected images on the canvas accordingly.

The connect_centers() method is called when the "Connect Centers" button is clicked. It calculates the center coordinates of the grouped images by averaging their positions. It then draws black lines from the calculated center to each individual image on the canvas.

The display_image_info(image_path) method is invoked when an image is double-clicked on the canvas. It opens a message box that displays the image's path, size (width x height), and fill color.

The main part of the code creates a Tkinter window, creates an instance of the ImageApp class, and starts the Tkinter event loop
